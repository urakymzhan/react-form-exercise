# react-form-exercise

## Instructions

1. init states and store todos
    - fetch todos, carefully check data (it has comleted attribute in it)
    - API: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

2. handle user search input
    - Hint: onChange, event.target.value

3. filter data based on search input
    - Hint: filter()

4. When clicked `Show Completed` filter data to show completed ones. Unchecked show all the todos regardless of value.
    - filter()

**HINTS**:
- change null values inside code with your code
- use completed attribute from API data
- on single todo click you search single todo from data and update only it's completed value 

**Things to consider:**
- What if your doesn't arrive from API
    - how do you handle it?
